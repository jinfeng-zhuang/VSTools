# VESDUMP

## Design

The threads does the simple things, make the logic simple.

## TODO

* get pts descriptor with dbgserver? or directly with HAL library
* add pts support in sx7b
* check dtv start event by check register?

## TIPS

We can start capture without channel change, use UDP tool send any data to the TV with port 8000.
